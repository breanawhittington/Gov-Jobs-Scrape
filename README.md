# Gov-Jobs-Scrape
Python Webscraping Project for governmentjobs.com. 
Note: do not abuse use of requesting information from governmentjobs.com

Created to gather jobs available on governmentjobs.com
Saves Job Lists in csv with headings title, location, salary, date_posted, job_url, job_summary
Prints out the Job Title each loop. This gives me a visual cue that it is working.
